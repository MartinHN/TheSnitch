### eear

*eear* is a smartphone app that analyses incoming audio and provides on-screen real-time musical information about the signal, that can be sent via OSC to a laptop or desktop computer for endless musical manipulation and sound-processing.

#### Features

*eear* provides tonal information about the music surrounding the user. It can work in **continuous mode**, providing chord estimations as the music evolves; or in **static mode**, listening for a time period selected by the user, delivering a global estimate of what could be considered the musical key of the music.

Furthermore, *eear* displays basic timbral information, including the degree of noisiness, loudness and spectral centroid (a measure of where most energy is located) of the sound. This information is sent via OSC so it could easily be used to influence musical developments, lighting applications or image processing.
